# Chatbot-V2
This repository shows a chatbot built in Pyton with NLTK. I have developed an impressive rule-based chatbot using just Python and the NLTK library. The NLTK's chat module utilizes various regular expression patterns in the user's intent and produces the corresponding output. This chatbot was made with a tutorial from [analyticsvidhya.com.](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/build-a-simple-chatbot-using-python-and-nltk/)

# How it works
A rule-based chatbot using Python and NLTK chat module works by matching user input to predefined patterns and providing corresponding responses. The NLTK chat module provides a framework for defining these patterns and responses, making it easy to create a simple chatbot. When a user inputs something, the module compares it to the predefined patterns and generates an appropriate response. If no match is found, the chatbot may return a default response or ask for more information.(this paragraph is generated with chatGPT)

# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- my name is (.*)
- what is your name ?
- how are you ?
- what (.*) want ?
- (.*) created ?
- how is weather in (.*)?
- quit

And more!

# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with a diffrent purpose.
