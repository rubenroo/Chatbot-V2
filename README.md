# How it works


# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- Say hello to the chatbot
- Ask for tips in case of sleep problems
- Ask to tell a joke
- Thanks the chatbot 
- Say goodby to the chatbot


# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with a diffrent purpose.
