# Chatbot-V2
This repository shows a chatbot built in Pyton with NLTK. I have developed an impressive rule-based chatbot using just Python and the NLTK library. The NLTK's chat module utilizes various regular expression patterns in the user's intent and produces the corresponding output. This chatbot was made with the help from [analyticsvidhya.com.]([https://github.com/robvdw/Digital-Humans](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/build-a-simple-chatbot-using-python-and-nltk/))

# How it works


# What the chatbot can do
The chatbot demonstrates the techniques mentioned above. The following questions are possible:

- Say hello to the chatbot
- Ask for tips in case of sleep problems
- Ask to tell a joke
- Thanks the chatbot 
- Say goodby to the chatbot


# Why this project
I have done the minor Real Fake, Real Impact. During the minor, I immersed myself in AI and Digital Humans. One of the topics was learning the basics of pyton. With the knowledge learned, I created 4 different chatbots. Each chatbot was built with different techniques and with a diffrent purpose.
